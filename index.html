      <p><strong>"Ninja Cat"</strong> is a game created by Australian
      PICO-8 game developer <a href="https://cubee.games">cubee</a>, originally released for the PICO-8 fantasy console in early 2021.</p>
      
      <p>In 2023, development for <strong>"Ninja Cat Remewstered"</strong> began,
      a <strong>remaster of the <em>original</em> PICO-8 version</strong> targeted for both Desktop and Android.</p>
      
      <p>The game was briefly a target for speedrunners, who managed to complete the game
      <em>in less than 3 minutes</em>, an incredible time considering cubee's own best time of around
      <em>5:17</em>.</p>
    
    <h3>Gameplay</h3>
      <p>Ninja Cat can throw shuriken.<br>
      He runs and jumps at high speed; he's not particularly sneaky despite being a ninja.<br>
      He can also use his headband as a grappling hook, making him move even faster!

    <h3>Obstacles</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Red Ninjas will run and jump to chase Ninja Cat.</li>
        <li>Shielded Ninjas walk slowly and blindly toward Ninja Cat, but are invulnerable to his attacks.</li>

      </ul>

    <h3>Development</h3>
